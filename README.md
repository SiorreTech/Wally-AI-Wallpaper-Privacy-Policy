      <h1>Wally Wallpaper – Privacy Policy</h1>
      <p class="muted"><strong>Last updated:</strong> December 17, 2025</p>
    </header>

    <div class="card">
      <p>
        This Privacy Policy explains how <strong>Wally Wallpaper</strong> (the “App”) collects, uses, and protects
        information when you use it. The App is developed by <strong>Siorre Technologies</strong> (“we”, “us”, or “our”).
      </p>
      <p>
        By using the App, you agree to the practices described in this Privacy Policy.
      </p>
    </div>

    <h2>1. Information We Collect</h2>
    <p>
      The App provides wallpapers and basic usage statistics. We do not require you to create an account, and we do not
      intentionally collect personally identifiable information (such as your name or email) unless you voluntarily provide it.
    </p>
    <p>
      We do <strong>not</strong> collect precise location data, contacts, messages, or sensitive personal identifiers.
    </p>

    <h3>1.1 Usage Data (App activity)</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Which wallpapers are viewed, liked, and downloaded (counts and IDs)</li>
      <li>Screens and features you use within the App</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      This information is generally processed in an anonymous or pseudonymous form and is not used to identify you personally.
    </p>

    <h3>1.2 Device and Log Data (Diagnostics)</h3>
    <p>
      Because we use third-party backend services (such as Supabase), these services may automatically collect certain technical data, for example:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>IP address</li>
      <li>Device type and operating system</li>
      <li>App version</li>
      <li>Crash reports and error logs</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      This data is used for security, debugging, reliability, and performance monitoring.
    </p>

    <h2>2. Device Permissions and Local Storage</h2>
    <p>The App may request certain permissions on your device, such as:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>Photos/Media Access</strong>
        (e.g., <code>READ_MEDIA_IMAGES</code> or equivalent permissions depending on Android version):
        <ul>
          <li>To download wallpapers to your device and save them to your gallery</li>
          <li>To mark wallpapers as downloaded or favorited and show these stats in your profile</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      These permissions are used only for wallpaper-related features provided by the App.
      Your personal photos are <strong>not</strong> uploaded to our servers.
    </p>

    <p>The App also uses local storage on your device (e.g., AsyncStorage) to store:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Your favorite wallpapers</li>
      <li>IDs of wallpapers you’ve downloaded</li>
      <li>App preferences (such as language or other settings)</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      These items are stored locally on your device and are not sent to our servers unless explicitly needed for a feature
      and clearly described in the App.
    </p>

    <h2>3. How We Use the Information</h2>
    <p>We use the collected data for the following purposes:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>To operate and improve the core features of the App (listing wallpapers, counts of downloads/likes, etc.)</li>
      <li>To show popular content and improve recommendations</li>
      <li>To analyze performance and fix bugs</li>
      <li>To maintain the security and integrity of the App</li>
      <li>To comply with legal obligations</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      We do not use your data for personalized advertising at this time.
    </p>

    <h2>4. Supabase and Other Third-Party Services</h2>
    <p>
      We use <strong>Supabase</strong> as our backend infrastructure provider.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Wallpapers and related statistics (such as download and like counts) may be stored in Supabase databases.</li>
      <li>Supabase processes this data on our behalf under its own privacy and security policies.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Supabase Privacy Policy:
      <a href="https://supabase.com/privacy" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://supabase.com/privacy</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      Currently, the App does not integrate advertising networks (such as AdMob) or third-party marketing SDKs.
      If we add such services in the future, we will update this Privacy Policy to clearly describe them.
    </p>

    <h2>5. How We Share Information</h2>
    <p>
      We do not sell your data. We may share data only in the following limited situations:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>Service Providers</strong> – with third-party providers that host, store, or process data for us (e.g., Supabase),
        strictly to operate the App.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Legal Requirements</strong> – when required to do so by law, court order, or competent authorities.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Business Transfers</strong> – if the App or our business is merged, acquired, or transferred, user data may be included
        as part of that transaction. In such a case, we will make reasonable efforts to notify you.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>6. Data Retention</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Usage and statistics data are kept for as long as necessary to operate and improve the App, unless a longer retention period is required by law.</li>
      <li>Data stored locally on your device (favorites, downloads, settings) is removed when you uninstall the App or clear its data.</li>
      <li>Certain logs and technical records may be retained longer to comply with legal obligations or resolve disputes.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>7. Data Security</h2>
    <p>We implement reasonable technical and organizational measures to protect your data, including:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Using secure connections (HTTPS)</li>
      <li>Restricting access to backend systems</li>
      <li>Regular updates and security maintenance</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      However, no method of transmission or storage is completely secure, and we cannot guarantee absolute security.
    </p>

    <h2>8. Children’s Privacy</h2>
    <p>
      The App may be used by children, including those under the age of 13. We comply with the Google Play Families Policy
      and applicable child data protection laws.
    </p>
    <p>
      We do not knowingly collect personal information from children (such as name, email, or precise location).
      If we become aware that personal information from a child has been collected unintentionally, we will delete it as soon as reasonably possible.
    </p>

    <h2>9. Your Rights</h2>
    <p>
      Depending on your location and applicable law, you may have some or all of the following rights:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>To request access to the data we hold about you</li>
      <li>To request correction or deletion of your data</li>
      <li>To object to or restrict certain types of processing</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      To exercise these rights, please contact us using the details below. We may need to verify your identity before responding to certain requests.
    </p>

    <h2>10. Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
    <p>
      We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. When we make material changes, we will try to notify you via the App
      or through other appropriate means. The latest version will always be available within the App or by request.
    </p>
